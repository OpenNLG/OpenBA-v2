how ot make meatballs,"To make basic meatballs, you’ll need 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup fine breadcrumbs, 1 large egg, 1 teaspoon salt, freshly ground black pepper, 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 1/4 cup finely minced Italian parsley, 1 pound ground meat (such as beef, pork, turkey, chicken, or veal, or a mix), 1/2 cup finely chopped onion (or grated on a coarse grater) from 1 small yellow onion, and 1 clove garlic      Combine the milk and breadcrumbs. Place the breadcrumbs in a small bowl, pour in the milk, and stir to combine. Set aside while preparing the rest of the meatball mixture. The breadcrumbs will absorb the milk and become soggy.

The meatballs are done when cooked through, the outsides are browned, and they register 165°F in the middle on an instant-read thermometer. Serve immediately.    Option 2: Cook the meatballs directly in sauce. Bring a marinara or other pasta sauce to a simmer and add as many meatballs as will fit comfortably in the pan. Cover and simmer for 30 to 35 minutes.

Lift the clump and gently shake off excess soil to reveal the bulbs.    Divide daffodil bulbs by twisting and pulling them off the clump. It usually takes a slight tug to separate the roots from the clump. Dispose of all damaged, mushy, infected looking bulbs.    If you wish to replant right away, sow them at the new site at the original depth, making sure the leafy growth is above, the bulb and white stem are under the soil line. Water well after replanting.    If you intend to replant daffodils in fall, you’ll need to store them properly so they can survive the stretch. Lay them all out indoors on clean, dry newspapers and leave them be for 7-10 days.    Remove the leaves when they’re crisp and brown and gently brush off any dirt that’s still sticking to the bulbs. Go easy, there’s no need to wash the bulbs or to get them absolutely spot free.    Place the bulbs in nylon or mesh bags (cleaned onion sacks will do just fine too), label them and then store them in a cool, dry but ventilated location.    Come fall, take out bulbs and inspect them. A soft bulb is a dead bulb and should be planted in a sunny location.
